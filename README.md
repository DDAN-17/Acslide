# Acslide

Acslide is an IDE for programmers who don't like Visual Studio or don't want to pay for JetBrains' Rider. It's open source, licensed under the MIT license, and made with the Godot game engine.

# Installation

To install Acslide, download the correct file for your operating system and follow the instructions:

## Linux

Just run the file, and it should work.

## Windows

Since the .exe has an embedded PCK, according to [the Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_windows.html#code-signing) some antivirus programs will flag Acslide as malware, but you can ignore them.

## MacOS

Follow the instructions on [the Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/running_on_macos.html#running-godot-apps-on-macos)
